    "<b>Feature Engineering</b> and Feature Selection are part of the Data Preparation stage of the CRISP-DM methodology. After data has been cleaned and explored, it must be transformed from raw, unstructured text into a structured numeric format that can be used as inputs for our models. Simpler Data Engineering techniques focus on vectorizing individual words, with little emphasis on the contexts of the words. We use Bag of Words and Bag of N-Grams to explore these simpler approaches. While easy to use, and not terribly demanding in terms of computer power required, these techniques are fundamentally less powerful than more modern, processor intensive techniques that concern themselves more with the context of the words. We use pre-trained word embeddings for our advanced feature engineering efforts, in order to avoid computational bottlenecks. If time allows, we may attempt to train our own embedding at some point. <b>Feature Selection</b> is an essential step, which allows us to identify which features are most important to the predictive abilities of our models. Filter methods of Feature Selection involve looking at individual features in isolation, giving them a score by which they can be ranked in terms of their usefulness. We use Univariate Chi-squared statistical tests. Wrapper methods of Feature Selection consider sets of features in combination, which can give deeper insights into which features to select given their interactions and correlations with one another. We use Recursive Feature Elimination and Bagged Decision Trees for this type of feature selection. There are also Embedded Feature Selection techniques, however, these are done in concert with the modeling phase of the project, and if they will be attempted, they will be attempted during the modeling phase of the project.\n",
